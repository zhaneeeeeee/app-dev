3. Crazy Little Things
: A junior schoolgirl Nam (Pimchanok Luevisetpaiboon) falls in love for her schoolboy senior Chone (Mario Maurer) but is afraid to show her feeling to him, partly because Chone is the everyone's idol and Nam regards herself as unpopular, homely looking, and average. She has nothing that can make him notice her.
